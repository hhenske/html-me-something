                    <h2 id="lcw" class = centered-title>LaunchCode work</h2>
                    <p>I've been struggling working full time and getting my LaunchCode work done.  Sometimes, I am turning things in flawed or not finished.  There are things I need to study more, but don't have time.  So, I plan to spend 3 hours a day on LaunchCode work.<br>I will probably finish assigned weekly work the first day, work on upcoming projects the next two days, and go back to study and finish things from earlier chapters the last day or two</p>

                    <h2 id="ex" class = centered-title>Exersize</h2>
                    <p>This is something that I love to do and it really helps manage stress and anxiety, as well as helping me manage my weight.  I love cycling and swimming, as well as kickboxing, and running is not as enjoyable, but is a great addition.  I haven't had time or really been in the shape I'd like to be in for competition, but that's something I will do more of, as a retired person. There are already a few races I have my eye on.  I just need to sign up.<br>I also enjoy hiking. My husband and I are currently doing a 52 hike challenge for 2021.</p>

                    <h2 id="wk" class = centered-title>Work</h2>
                    <p>Even though I'm retired, I still will have to pay health care. Missouri has one of the best teacher pension systems in the country, but healthcare is expensive. So, I will need to work.  I have driven Uber and Lyft and shopped for Instacart, all of which, I enjoy, but since marriage and the start of my LaunchCode program, I just haven't had the time.  I plan to drive for a couple of hours in the early morning and a couple of hours in the afternoon, 3 or 4 days a week for some extra cash.</p>
                    <p>Then, of course, once I'm finished with LaunchCode, I could potentially launch my 2nd career as a Front End Web developer!</p>

                    <h2 id="time" class = centered-title>Spend time with family</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have two adult daughters, an aging dad who's single, and a new husband, all of us with busy lives.  Being retired will enable me to be available when they are to spend time with them. (and any grandchildren that may come along).  I can petsit (babysit) help them with moves, take them to lunch, give them rides from the autoshop, and go shopping with them.

                    <h2 id="ren" class = centered-title>Renovate the House (and move)</h2>
                    <p>I bought a condo a couple of years ago, resigning to be single.  Then, I met my husband.  We married and he has a house that has fallen into disrepair, due to neglect, an extended illness and a couple of guys living there alone.  It needs a lot of work and we don't have a lot of money to work with.</p>
                    <p>We're living in my condo while we renovate the house.  The plan is to rent the condo to one of his adult children and his wife.  They are anxious to get out of their apartment.  So, every free minute we have that we're not out on bikes, running or hiking..... or at work, we are there, tearing things down, putting things in, sanding, painting, installing, and cleaning.  As soon as we can move, bathrooms done, as well as floors in bedroom and living room, we will.  It should be some time this summer.</p>

                    <h2 id="clean" class = centered-title>Keeping it Clean and Organized</h2>
                    <p>Clearly, with all of the interests, hobbies and neat stuff I am enjoying, something suffers.  It's definately the housework.  I love to have clean surfaces and floors, organized paperwork and kitchen and bath, clean bathrooms, expecially toilets and sinks, and vacuumed carpet.  But the reality of working and doing all that I do..... None of that is happening on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p>Since I don't really enjoy the actual cleanning, (Who does?) my plan is to start the day with 2 chores, do a thing between each new activity, and do a quick tidy at the end of the day.  If one of those doesn't happen, no big deal.  It'll still be better than it is now.</p>

                    <h2 id="learn" class = centered-title>Other Learning</h2>
                    <p>This is with the "extra" time I may or may not have.  I would love to finish with Python learning that I started before I knew I got into LaunchCode.  I would also love to go back through my Repplits and finish and clean up things that caused me problems the first time.  I'd like to finish a course in JavaScript that I bought.  That way, I can start at the beginning and get a little more confident and solid.</p>
                    <p>Once those things are complete, if I am still working on CoderGirl, I'd like to start some kind of certifications to make me more marketable.  My software engineer daughter has a lot of suggestions.  Or, I could start working with her on interview questions practice.</p>
